                <h4> STAT 207 - Data Science Exploration </h4>
                <p>
                    Covered the data science pipeline from hypothesis formulation to data collection, management, analysis, and reporting, with topics including data preprocessing, visualization, probability models, hypothesis testing, regression modeling, and machine learning for high-dimensional data. Implemented these methods using Python and Git version control.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <a href="projects/STAT207_FinalProject.html">Final Project</a> - In this final project, I worked with a group to develop a logistic regression model that aims to effectively predict penguin clutch completion for new datasets. Utilized Jupyter Notebooks, Visual Studio Code, and various Python libraries (e.g. NumPy, Scikit-Learn).
                </ul>
                
                <h4> CS 416 - Data Visualization </h4>
                <p>
                    Explored how databases, computer graphics, and perceptual psychology enhance data visualization to improve user understanding of large datasets. E.g. effective chart selection and construction, dashboard organization, and designing for user engagement and interaction.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="projects/VidGameTableau.html">Video Game Tableau Visualization</a> - In this project, I created a Tableau dashboard that visualizes video game sales and ratings data, allowing users to explore trends and insights interactively.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="./CS416NarViz/CS416NarViz-A.html">Video Game Narrative Visualization</a> - In this project, I created a narrative visualization using D3.js that tells the story of video game sales and ratings over time, highlighting key trends and insights through interactive graphics.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> 
                    Integrated and analyzed datasets on video game sales and ratings, creating insightful visualizations using Tableau and JavaScript (D3.js).
                </p>

                <h4>CS 307 - Model & Learning in Data Sci</h4>
                <p>
                    Applied classical and modern data modeling techniques, including feature engineering, linear models, supervised/unsupervised learning, and deep learning, to solve numerous data-centric problems. Utilized Jupyter Notebooks, Visual Studio Code, and various Python libraries (e.g. NumPy, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: The original data that was used in these projects was not collected by me, but rather was provided by the course. The data is no longer available online, but the reports and notebooks are still available for viewing.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="projects/lab-01-notebook.html">Temperature Model</a> - In this report, we develop a model to predict the minimum daily temperature of Lincoln Square. Our primary intention is to reliably predict in advance when the the local Urbana Farmer's Market should switch to indoors, as the market is only outdoors during reasonable weather.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="projects/lab-02-notebook.html">Credit Ratings Model</a>  - In this report, we develop a regression model that predicts the credit rating for an individual based on income and demographic information. By building this model, we would be able to save a bank money by avoiding the costs of relying on credit agencies to provide customer credit ratings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="projects/lab-03-notebook.html">Pitch Classification</a>  - In this report, we develop a classification model that predicts the pitch type of a pitch thrown by Shohei Ohtani given the pitch's velocity, rotation, movement, and position of the batter. By building this model, we aim to be able to automatically and reliably display the pitch type for each pitch in real-time to both the stadium and television broadcast.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="projects/lab-05-notebook.html">Wine Quality Predictor</a>  - In this report, we develop a regression model that predicts a wine's quality given its physicochemical characteristics. By building this model, we aim to create an "AI" Sommelier that is able to reliably predict the wine quality based on previous wine quality reviews by human sommeliers, removing the need for a highly trained human.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="projects/lab-06-notebook.html">Cancer Type Predictor</a>  - In this report, we develop a classification model that predicts a cancer type given gene expression data. By building this model, we aim to work towards a proof of concept, exploring the possibility of developing a "universal" cancer detection and classification model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="projects/lab-07-notebook.html">Credit Card Fraud Detector</a>  - In this report, we develop a classification model that predicts if a given credit card transaction is fraudulent or genuine. By building this model, we aim to work towards an automated fraud detector, aiming to find one that appropriately balances false positives and false negatives.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="projects/lab-08-notebook.html">Tweet Sentiment Classifier</a>  - In this report, we develop a classification model that predicts if a given twitter post ("tweet") is one of negative, neutral, or positive sentiment. By building this model, we aim to build a sentiment classifier that will alert airline customer service representatives to respond to negative tweets about the airline and for positive tweets to be automatically acknowledged.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="projects/lab-09-notebook.html">MLB Swing Probability Model</a>  - In this report, we aim to develop a well calibrated probability model that estimates the probability of inducing a batter to swing given the characteristics of a pitch thrown, in addition to other information such as game situation, for a particular pitcher.

                <ul>
                    <a href="projects/vgsales-app.zip">Video Game Sales Shiny App</a> - The purpose of this application is to provide an easy and quick way to compare video game sales trends over the years. The user is able to specify a publisher, platform and genre to filter the data for more specific trends.
